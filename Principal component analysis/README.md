Principal Component Analysis provides a mechanism to reduce dimensionality and simplify datasets without losing the valuable information they inherently contain.
- Principal components are a linear combination of all the input features from the original dataset. By using the eigenvectors we calculated earlier, we can “rotate” our dataset features from an n-dimensional space into a 2-dimensional space, which is easier for us to understand and analyze.
- PCA will look at overall similarities between the different features in a dataset (like k-means algo)
- for image processing: reduce the number of features for the image with minimal information loss and continue their processing.
