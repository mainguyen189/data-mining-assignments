A one-sample t-test can be implemented in Python using the SciPy ttest_1samp() function

Assumptions of a one-sample t-test include:
- The sample was randomly drawn from the population of interest
- The observations in the sample are independent
- The sample size is large “enough” or the sample data is normally distributed
