- and preceding steps)
- Relationship between/What for

Spearman rank correlation coefficient
- Shapiro-Wilk Normality test 
- All 


2 sample t-test
- Fligner-Killeen test variance equal/unequal
- one categorical variable (2 levels) and one continuous (interval) variable

X-square contingency table (interdependence test) 
- Categorical variable and categorical variable


One-way ANOVA
- Equal variance across groups: Flinger-Killen test of homogeneity of variance (violated, #2 hold → unequal-variance version of F-test)
- Each population is normally distributed: Shapiro-Wilk test each group (violated → alt=Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test)
- one categorical variable (>2 levels) and one continuous (interval) variable


Two-factor ANOVA
- Two categorical variable (and their interaction) and one continuous variable


Linear regression
- Continuous variables can be directly included in regression analysis.
- Categorical variables must be converted into dummy variables.


Residual Analysis 
- Normally distributed: Shapiro-Wilk normality test of the residuals
- Test of constant variance: Breusch-Pagan Test
- After regression to validate model

Multicollinearity: detect=Variance inflation factors(VIFs)
- After regression to make sure no inflated standard error & instability in model


Non-linearity and interaction (usually just quadratic)
- Numeric variable and numeric variable
- Or
- Categorical and categorical variable
