hyperparameter tuning
  + learning rate
  + batch size
  + number of epochs
  + model size (number of hidden layers/neurons and number of parameters)
  + regularization (dropout)



ROC curve gives us the relationship between our true positive rate and our false positive rate. Like with accuracy, we want our AUC to be as close to 1.0 as possible.
