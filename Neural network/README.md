Regression steps:
- Preparing the data for learning
- separating features from labels using array slicing
- determining the shape of your data
- preprocessing the categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- splitting the data into training and test sets
- scaling the numerical features
- hyperparameter tuning
  + learning rate
  + batch size
  + number of epochs
  + model size (number of hidden layers/neurons and number of parameters)
  + regularization (dropout)
