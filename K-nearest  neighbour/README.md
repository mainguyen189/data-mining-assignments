KNN regression: predict car price (continuous variables)

KNN classifier: predict breast cancer (discreet variables)


K-nearest neighbors computes the Euclidean Distance to find similarity and average to predict anunseen value:
- Data with n features can be conceptualized as points lying in n-dimensional space.
- Data points can be compared by using the distance formula. Data points that are similar will have a smaller distance between them.
- A point with an unknown class can be classified by finding the k nearest neighbors
- By using a weighted average, data points that are extremely similar to the input point will have more of a say in the final result.
